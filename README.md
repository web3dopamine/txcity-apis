# Txcity Frontend

#### This code has not had a major update for several years. It is going open source now so that other can develop their own new version of a Txcity frontend.

#### If you have any questions, please ask on Discord for a quick response: https://discord.gg/pFeHv623D7

# Summary

Txcity is a live transaction and mempool visualizer featuring Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Monero and Litecoin. When a new transaction is broadcasted to a cryptocurrency network, a person appears and attempts to board a bus in real time. If the transaction has a high enough fee, they will board the first bus and be ready to be included in the next mined block. If there are too many transactions to be included in the next block, and the transaction didn't pay a high enough fee, the person will either wait in line or board a different bus. The movement speed of a person represents how high of a fee they paid compared to the current median fee. The size of a person represents the size of the transaction in bytes or gas.

The frontend is built with Vue, Bulma and Phaser 3. It connects to Txcity backends using websockets (socket.io) and REST APIs.

# Running Locally

-   Install NodeJS (tested with v16.5)
-   Install Yarn (`npm install -g yarn`)
-   Install Git

-   Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/web3dopamine/txcity-apis.git`
-   Copy the contents of `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`
-   Run the command `yarn`
-   Run the command `yarn run build`
-   For a live dev server run the command `yarn run serve`

# Important Files

-   `src/components/street.js` is the main class that most coins inherit from to create a Phaser scene. It has most of the logic for creating game objects, updating the scene, and most of the blockchain logic. Arbitrum uses `mall.js` instead.
-   `src/components/street-controller.js` is the parent scene that manages all of the street scenes.
-   `src/components/config.js` is the main config file for all of the coins added to Txcity. Static variables for each coin can be found here, and the logic for each coin is in the `src/components/streets` directory.
-   `src/components/game-objects/person.js` is the class for the Person game object, which has a lot of the logic for creating "move lists", which are instructions for a person to move depending on the status of the transaction.
-   `src/components/game-objects/bus.js` is the class for the Bus game object, which has the logic for drawing the buses, the people and NFTs inside the buses, and moving the buses.
-   `src/components/vue` is the directory that has all of the Vue components, and everything related to the UI. The `Main.vue` file is the root component for the application and controls routing.

# Connecting to the Backend

If you would like to run and/or develop your own backend, please ask on Discord for access to the backend repository, since it is not open source yet. You will need to run your own blockchain nodes, a mongodb cluster, redis, and nodejs processes all on the same subnet. Eventually, this project will be run 100% by third party backends.

# REST API

The official Txcity REST API is currently hosted at `https://kapi.txcity.io`

Supported ticker variables - `BTC`,`ETH`,`BCH`,`XMR`,`LTC`

## Block

**GET** `/static/blocks/{ticker}/{blockHash}?verbose={true|false}`

Returns a block by the block hash. Only recent blocks are serviceable to support the visualization. Verbose is set to true by default. If true, the `txFull` object is omitted from the response.

**GET** `/api/v2/blockchain/addresses/{ticker}/{blockHeight}`

Returns a block by the block height. Only recent blocks are serviceable to support the visualization.

## Pending Transaction List

**GET** `/static/live/pendingTxs-{ticker}`

Returns a list of 3000 current pending transactions, sorted descending by the fee rate and taking into account the nonce (if applicable). Updates every few seconds.

## Trending Contracts

**GET** `/static/live/trending-contracts-ETH-{5min|1hour|1day}`

Returns an array of trending contracts on Ethereum, based on the number of transactions within a time period. Options for the time period are 5 minutes, 1 hour and 1 day.

## Houses

**GET** `/static/live/houses-{ticker}`

Get a list of houses for this ticker that are supported by the backend. The frontend uses this call to build the houses before loading any transactions.

## Address

**GET** `/api/v2/blockchain/addresses/{ticker}/{address}`

Returns a list of pending and recently confirmed transactions for an address.

## Transaction

**GET** `/api/v2/blockchain/addresses/{ticker}/{txid}`

Returns a pending or recently confirmed transaction from a transaction hash.

# Websocket API

The official Txcity Websocket API is currently hosted at `https://ksocket.txcity.com`

Supported ticker variables - `BTC`,`ETH`,`BCH`,`XMR`,`LTC`

To see how the frontend connects using socket.io see the `getSocket` function in `src/components/utils/index.js`

The `joinRoom` function is used to join rooms and subscribe to events, and the `joinStatRoom` function is used to fetch statistics and subscribe to updates for that statistic.

## Joining a Room

`["join-room","ETH-transactions"]` is an example of a message you can send to join a room and subscribe to new pending Ethereum transactions.

`{ticker}-transactions` subscribes to new pending transactions for the provided ticker. Events are emitted as `['tx', transactionObject]`.

`{ticker}-blocks` subscribes to new confirmed block hashes for the provided ticker. Events are emitted as `['block', blockHash]`. You can then use this hash to fetch the block data from the REST API.

## Leaving a Room

You can leave a room the same way you join it. For example, to leave the Ethereum transactions room send the following message `["leave-room","ETH-transactions"]` and you will stop receiving events.

To stop receiving updates for statistics, the message would be formatted like so `["leave-room","{ticker}-stat-{statKey}"]`. An example would be `["leave-room","ETH-stat-tps"]`.

## Fetching a Statistic

The Txcity backend keeps track of the following statistics in real time. Other stats are calculated in the frontend.

| blockGasEstimates     | A JSON array of gas estimates for the next 3 blocks. There is no history for this stat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ETH                 |

An example of a message to fetch a stat, return the current value and subscribe to new events would be:

```json
[
	"fetch-stat",
	"ETH", //ticker
	null, //identifier
	{
		"key": "tps", //stat key
		"history": false,
		"subscribe": true,
		"returnValue": true
	}
]
```

This would return the current value for Ethereum transactions per second and subscribe to future updates. The returned message and updates would look like:

```json
["stat-updates", "ETH", "tps", 10.35]
```

### Fetching History

There is also the option to return history for most statistics. An example message would be:

```json
[
	"fetch-stat",
	"ETH", //ticker
	"ETH-stat-history-baseFee", //custom identifier
	{
		"key": "baseFee", //stat key
		"history": true, //fetch history
		"historyDuration": "2d", //return the last 2 days of history
		"historyInterval": "5m", //the stat values will have 5 minute intervals
		"subscribe": false, //don't subscribe to events
		"returnValue": false //don't return the current value
	}
]
```

The returned message would look like:

```json
[
   "fetch-stat",
   "ETH-stat-history-baseFee",
   null,
   {
      "history":[
         {
            "value":24577025109.40936,
            "time":1690654503
         },
         ...
      ]
   }
]
```

The options for history are:

| Key             | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| history         | boolean | Should this request return historical data?                                                                                                                                      |
| historyInterval | string  | The interval to return history data in milliseconds, or use format... (30s, 30m, 30h, 30d, 30w). Supplying '5s' here means we want the stat values in 5 second intervals.        |
| historyDuration | string  | The maximum duration of history to return in milliseconds, or use format... (30s, 30m, 30h, 30d, 30w). Supplying '15m' here means to return the last 15 minutes of stat updates. |

## Recent House Transactions

Sending `['get-recent-house-txs', '{ticker}']` will return the 5 most recent transactions for each house.

It will be returned as `['get-recent-house-txs', null, null, transactionsArray]`.

# Sprites and Assets

The sprite sheets are built using Texture Packer.
https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker

The .tps files in the `texture-packer` directory can be opened in Texture Packer and edited. Click "Publish Sprite Sheet" at the top to publish your sprite sheet to a .png and .json file in `/public/static/img`.

---

# Adding a House

House data is loaded from the backend and transactions are modified to include house data on the backend before being sent to the frontend. If you want to add a house, you would need access to the backend, and then add the house logo to the sheet.tps file in this repository. You can request access to the backend repo on Discord.

---

# Adding a New Blockchain

You can create your own backend for a specific blockchain, fork the frontend and create a PR with your coin added and connecting to your hosted backend. You can also consider hosting your own version of the frontend instead of creating a PR.
